      <description>This is a summary of the book &amp;ldquo;Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)&amp;rdquo; from F5 Security.
Understanding WAF Basics In today’s digital economy, web applications are a primary target for attackers. Traditional security tools don’t provide adequate protection for your business-critical applications.
Looking at Essential WAF Capabilities A WAF protects applications by applying a set of rules to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) sessions that web applications use for communication.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6: Reconnaissance Phase 1 The idea behind horizontal correlation is to find all assets related to a company. This could be acquisitions, CIDR ranges, and domains that are owned by the same person. Vertical correlation when dealing with domains involves finding all subdomains belonging to a single domain.
CIDR Range A Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range is a short way of representing a group of IP addresses. Compromising a server hosted on a company’s CIDR range may lead you directly into their internal network therefore these assets are considered critical and are ideal targets.</description>

      <description>Chapter 21: A Web Application Hacker’s Methodology by @sl4x0 بسم الله الرحمن الرحيمInformation gathered in one stage may enable you to return to an earlier stage and formulate more focused attacks. For example, an access control bug that enables you to obtain a listing of all users may enable you to perform a more effective password-guessing attack against the authentication function. Discovering a key vulnerability in one area of the application may enable you to shortcut some of the work in other areas.</description>
