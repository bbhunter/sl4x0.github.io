<h2 id="synonymous-terms-and-types-of-hackers">Synonymous Terms and Types of Hackers</h2>
<p><strong>White hat hackers</strong>: Ethical hackers (aka pentesters).
<strong>Gray hat hackers:</strong> Gray hats fall into a fuzzy area. Their intent is not always malicious, but it is not always ethical either.
<strong>Black hat hackers:</strong> Their intent and purpose are illegal. Cyber criminals fall into this category.</p>
<p>A <strong>purple team</strong> is simply a small group of people who help to facilitate communication between the red team and blue team</p>
<p><strong>Hacktivists</strong> are activists that use their hacking skills to support <strong>social change</strong>, <strong>human rights</strong>,
<strong>freedom of speech</strong>, or <strong>environmental causes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="pentests-described">Pentests Described</h2>
<p><strong>Vulnerability scanning</strong> alone or running an application to find vulnerabilities in targeted computers and devices only detects limited vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Pentesters</strong> use similar, or sometimes the same, <em>tactics</em>, <em>techniques</em>, and <em>procedures</em> (<strong>TTPs</strong>) as are used by <strong>cyber criminals</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-and-reasons">Benefits and Reasons</h2>
<p>The benefit of pentesting is that it provides a view of the security posture from an adversary’s point of view.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the most common reasons for pentests are as follows:</strong></p>
<p>■ <strong>Discovering</strong> and <strong>remediating</strong> vulnerabilities in order to mitigate possible breaches.</p>
<p>■ <strong>Regulatory compliance</strong> is a major driver for companies to conduct pentests.</p>
<p><strong>Some areas that can benefit from an understanding of pentesting are as follows:</strong></p>
<p>■ Security operations center (SOC) analysts</p>
<p>■ Network security analysts and engineers</p>
<p>■ Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)</p>
<p>■ Purple teams (a collaboration of defensive and offensive security)</p>
<p>■ Application security</p>
<h2 id="legality-and-permission">Legality and Permission</h2>
<p>The statement of work (<strong>SOW</strong>) should include verbiage giving pentesters permission to perform the pentest.</p>
<h2 id="pentest-methodology">Pentest Methodology</h2>
<p>A <strong>pentest methodology</strong> is a repeatable process that other pentesters on a team can duplicate to deliver consistent quality.</p>
<p><strong>The following list contains some common industry-recognized pentesting methodologies:</strong></p>
<p>Penetration Testing Execution Standard (<strong>PTES</strong>): <a href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page">The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (pentest-standard.org)</a></p>
<p>Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (<strong>OSSTMM</strong>): <a href="https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf">https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf</a></p>
<p>NIST 800-115 (National Institute of Standards and Technology): <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final">Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment)</a></p>
<p>OWASP Testing Guide (Open Web Application Security Project): <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/wstg%5Bweb-app-pentest%5D">https://github.com/OWASP/wstg[web-app-pentest]</a></p>
<p><strong>The seven sections of the PTES are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-engagement Interactions</li>
<li>Intelligence Gathering</li>
<li>Threat Modeling</li>
<li>Vulnerability Analysis</li>
<li>Exploitation</li>
<li>Post Exploitation</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ol>
<p>For More Details for Each Step : <a href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page">The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (pentest-standard.org)</a></p>
<h3 id="pre-engagement-interactions">Pre-engagement Interactions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the <strong>planning phase</strong>, and it introduces the <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong> to be used during the pentests. The <strong>scope</strong> of a pentest is defined during this phase, as well as the cost, <strong>beginning</strong> and <strong>ending</strong> times, and allowed testing times. Pentesting has the potential to cause outages, so <strong>testing times</strong> need to be agreed upon with the client, and the hours for testing and start and end dates for the pentest should be included in the SOW. Questionnaires are used to help define the scope of the pentest and to plan it. The <strong>goals of the pentest</strong> should be discussed during this phase, and understanding them is helpful in scoping a successful pentest. The <strong>rules of engagement</strong> should be determined, which define how the pentest is to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="intelligence-gathering">Intelligence Gathering</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In this phase, intelligence is gathered on targets to discover vulnerabilities and information that can be used to exploit the target. Information like <strong>operating system</strong> (OS) and <strong>software versions</strong> are useful in determining if a target is vulnerable and exploitable. Other types of intelligence gathering could require finding out information about individuals, companies, and organizations through the Internet. Intelligence gathering is also referred to as reconnaissance and Open Source Intelligence (<strong>OSINT</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="threat-modeling">Threat Modeling</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Threat modeling is a process by which <strong>potential threats</strong>, such as <strong>software</strong> or <strong>OS</strong> <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>, can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized—all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. The purpose of threat modeling in pentesting is to provide a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. This information is used to attack the target. Threat modeling is especially important on more complex targets, and can be more difficult and time-consuming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="vulnerability-analysis">Vulnerability Analysis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Vulnerability analysis is the process of <strong>discovering flaws</strong> in systems and applications that can be leveraged by an attacker. These flaws can range anywhere from <strong>host</strong> and <strong>service</strong> <strong>misconfiguration</strong> to insecure application design. Tools such as <strong>port</strong> and <strong>service scanners</strong> and <strong>vulnerability scanners</strong> are used to discover vulnerabilities. The discovered vulnerabilities are validated to ensurethat they are truly vulnerable and not <strong>false positives</strong>, and then analyzed to verify if they can be exploited. Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, but they should be included in the report. Vulnerabilities that are not exploitable at the time of the pentest could exploited later if an exploit is developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This phase of a pentest focuses solely on <strong>hacking vulnerable systems detected</strong> during the vulnerability analysis phase of the pentest. There are many different things that you could do in this phase, which will depend on what you’re testing, and the scope defined in your SOW. It can include using vulnerability scanners, attempting attacks on web applications, trying to access areas of buildings where outsiders aren’t permitted, trying to fool human beings, and various other activities that may be attempted by real cyberattackers. Occasionally, you may have to use your imagination, but be sure only to try what is allowed according to your contract! Chapter 5, “Building a Pentesting Lab,” will explain the many actions you’ll take in this phase in much greater detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="post-exploitation">Post Exploitation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this phase is to determine the <strong>value of the compromised system</strong> and to <strong>maintain control</strong> for later use. The value of the system is determined by the sensitivity of the data stored on it and its usefulness in further exploiting other systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This phase of the pentest is where the results and findings are <strong>documented</strong>. The pentest report should have an <strong>executive summary</strong> where the results are communicated in language that can be understood by <strong>nontechnical staff</strong>. This section of the report is important for explaining the results to management and the various business lines of the organization. Information on vulnerabilities should be documented, reporting on systems that were exploitable and providing <strong>details and evidence</strong> of the exploitation. <strong>Screenshots</strong> and ample evidence should be provided to show proof of the vulnerabilities and exploited
systems. <strong>Recommendations</strong> and <strong>remediation</strong> information, as well as <strong>risk ratings</strong> for vulnerabilities, should also be contained in the report</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pentest-types">Pentest Types</h2>
<p><strong>Black box</strong>: The target knowledge for this type of pentest is <strong>very limited</strong>. For a web application, it is typically just the <strong>URL</strong> of the application. In the case of a network pentest, it can be an <strong>IP address</strong> or <strong>list of IP addresses</strong>. In some cases, the pentester may only know the <strong>company name</strong>, and it is up to the pentester to use <strong>reconnaissance</strong> to discover IP addresses or URLs to
assess. Black box pentests <strong>mimic a malicious hacker</strong> more than the other methods.</p>
<p><strong>White box</strong>: Also referred to as a <strong>crystal box pentest</strong>, in this type of pentest, the pentester is provided with a lot of <strong>detailed information</strong> on the target being tested. This information can include <strong>documents</strong>, <strong>diagrams</strong>, and the <strong>user credentials</strong> of <strong>different user permissions</strong> <strong>levels</strong>. You want to make sure that a normal user of the application cannot access administrative functions.</p>
<p><strong>Gray box</strong>: This type of target knowledge falls between black box and white box testing. Gray box pentests are the most common type of the three. The amount of knowledge that you’ll have could be anywhere between the extremes of the ignorance of an outsider up to the familiarity of a network administrator. For instance, you might start with as much knowledge of
the network as a company insider who doesn’t work in the IT department.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Time</strong> can be a <strong>factor</strong> in deciding between black box, white box, and gray box pentests.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="vulnerability-scanning">Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vulnerability scanning</em> is often part of a pentest, but it is not required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vulnerability scanners are used to detect <strong>specific vulnerabilities</strong> that are publicly known and for which programmers have developed tests, and can help speed up the vulnerability discovery process.</p>
<p>■ <a href="http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus">Nessus</a>: is a vulnerability scanner by Tenable.</p>
<p>■ <a href="http://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose">Nexpose</a>: is a vulnerability scanner offered by Rapid7, the creators of the Metasploit exploitation tool.</p>
<p>■ <a href="http://www.openvas.org/">Openvas</a>: is a vulnerability scanner by Greenbone Networks, which offers a free and commercial version of Openvas.</p>
<p>■ <a href="http://www.qualys.com/">Qualys</a>: offers a VMDR cloud-based vulnerability scanner. It’s sold through paid subscription, and it is efficient to use, as Qualys’s own cloud handles the computing load.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-assessments">Vulnerability Assessments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Security vulnerability assessments</em> are a good starting place for junior or entry-level pentesters.</p>

<h2 id="pentest-targets-and-specializations">Pentest Targets and Specializations</h2>
<p><strong>Some areas where a pentester can specialize are as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generalist</strong> (network, Wi-Fi, and light web app)
<strong>Application</strong> (web app, mobile, thick client, and cloud)
<strong>Internet of Things</strong> (IoT)
<strong>Industrial Control Systems</strong> (ICS)
<strong>Hardware</strong> (including medical devices)
<strong>Social engineering</strong> (people)
<strong>Physical</strong> (buildings)
<strong>Transportation</strong> (vehicles, airplanes)
<strong>Red team</strong> (adversarial simulation)</p>
<h3 id="generalist-pentesting">Generalist Pentesting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Generalists perform pentests on local area networks, and Wi-Fi networks and do some light web application pentesting. Pentesters commonly start out as generalists, and individuals with an IT or system administrator background are typically a good fit in this category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="application-pentesting">Application Pentesting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Application pentesting includes thick client applications, web applications, mobile applications, and cloud applications. This is a great area for people with a software development background or application security background.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="internet-of-things-iot">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IoT can be used to monitor temperature and other conditions of an environment or systems. It can also be used to track inventory and shipping containers, to name some of IoT’s functions. It is important to pentest IoT devices in order to prevent data breaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="industrial-control-systems-ics">Industrial Control Systems (ICS)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Industrial control systems (ICS) are a similar technology to IoT, but they are used to manage industrial equipment including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and control systems for water treatment facilities and energy production plants. Critical.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="hardware-and-medical-devices">Hardware and Medical Devices</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hardware includes in this category in network devices, such as routers and switches, and
medical devices. This category has some crossover to IoT.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="social-engineering">Social Engineering</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Social engineering is a type of security assessment that targets the human element.</p>
<p>Social engineering leverages the use of phishing emails to collect information, or user credentials, or deliver malware to collect information, log keystrokes, or remotely control the victim’s computer. Social engineers also use USB drives and CDs loaded with malware to exploit computers when the media is inserted into the victim’s computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="physical-pentesting">Physical Pentesting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Physical pentests target buildings and all types of facilities. Due to the potential risks, it is critical to pentest physical security.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="transportation-pentesting">Transportation Pentesting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Transportation pentesting involves trains, airplanes, cars, buses, and trucks, including self-driven vehicles (also known as autonomous vehicles). This makes this another critical
technology to pentest.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="red-team-pentesting">Red Team Pentesting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Red team pentesting, also known as adversarial simulation, mimics <strong>threat actors</strong>.
As Wirefall, Dallas Hackers Association founder says, “The red team tests the blue team.” The blue team is a common term used for information security personnel—the defenders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="career-outlook">Career Outlook</h2>
<p>The need for pentesters will continue to grow, especially since not every company currently has its own pentest team in place, and this is a new addition to most information security programs.</p>
<p><strong>Other areas of information security where pentesting skills and knowledge are useful include the following:</strong></p>
<p>■ SOC (security operations center) analysts</p>
<p>■ DFIR (digital forensics and incident response)</p>
<p>■ Network security analysts and engineers</p>
<p>■ Red team and blue team working collaboratively, with or without a purple team</p>
<p>■ Application security</p>
<p>■ Security researchers</p>
