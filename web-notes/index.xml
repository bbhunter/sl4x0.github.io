How to Exploit WebSocket | WebSocket for Beginners
WebSockets are widely used in modern web applications. They are initiated over HTTP and provide long-lived connections with asynchronous communication in both directions.
WebSockets are used for various purposes, including user actions and transmitting sensitive information.
Virtually any web security vulnerability that arises with regular HTTP can also arise in relation to WebSockets communications.</description>

References Sensitive Information Disclosure
Mechanisms Information disclosure occurs when an application fails to properly protect sensitive information, giving users access to information they shouldn’t have available to them.
This sensitive information can include technical details that aid an attack, like software version numbers, internal IP addresses, sensitive filenames, filepaths, user’s age, bank account numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses, to unauthorized third parties.</description>

      <description>Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that lets an attacker send requests on behalf of a server. During an SSRF, attackers forge the request signatures of the vulnerable server, allowing them to assume a privileged position on a network, bypass firewall controls, and gain access to internal services.

      <description>SQL is a programming language used to query or modify information stored within a database. A SQL injection is an attack in which the attacker executes arbitrary SQL commands on an application’s database by supplying malicious input inserted into a SQL statement.
This happens when the input used in SQL queries is incorrectly filtered or escaped and can lead to authentication bypass, sensitive data leaks, tampering of the database, and RCE in some cases.</description>

      <guid>https://sl4x0.github.io/web-notes/insecure-deserialization/</guid>
      <description>Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities happen when applications deserialize program objects without proper precaution. An attacker can then manipulate serialized objects to change the program’s behavior.
Mechanisms Serialization is the process by which some bit of data in a programming language gets converted into a format that allows it to be saved in a database or transferred over a network.
Deserialization refers to the opposite process, whereby the program reads the serialized object from a file or the network and converts it back into an object.</description>

      <description>XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application&amp;rsquo;s processing of XML data.
It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. XXEs can be very impactful bugs, as they can lead to confidential information disclosure, SSRFs, and DoS attacks.</description>
